# Ways to the Game of Life -- The Fourth Way

*Here we continue upon our dual-purpose journey: to learn Pyton by implementing
a version of Conway's Game of Life. Here we assume you have completed the
previous two notebooks to your satisfaction.*


## Overview

In examining the code of others we are going to try to pay
attention to the same things we consider in creating our own code:

+ Nature of the data model.
+ Input and output types of functions.
+ Complexity
    + Number of packages imported.
    + Number of functions declared.


### Lab Overview

Our learning goals for this notebook:
+ Reinforce a science and mathematics based approach to problem solving.
+ Introduction to learning new mathematics through code.


### Lab Objectives

Our learning goals for this notebook:
+ Learn and implement a convolution for the Game of Life.
+ Reinforce and reflect upon our prior implementations.

## Lab

Unlike the previous labs I offer no restrictions here, only the guidance
implied by the code given in the notebook.


### Task: Implement the Game of Life using a convolution

+ [ ] Implement the Game of Life using a convolution.
  + The real goal is in the learning.
