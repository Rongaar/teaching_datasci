# Introductory Lessons into Data Science

## Defining our Scope of Data Science

What is "Data Science"?
+ Examination of data.
+ Conversion from a scientific hypothesis into an experimental program.
+   Understand to whatever degree is needed.
+ Expertise link.

What is it not?
+ Computer Science
+ (Program) Engineering

## Pedagogical Philosophy

> For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.
>  -Aristotle

These lessons provide a platform through which you may learn by doing. We declare
a goal at the start of a lesson and iterate on our solution. In doing real data
science it critical to remember your goal is (almost always) to program or
implement a solution to a scientific hypothesis. Our goal here is to give you
the programming tools and wherewithal so that you can do so for any (reasonable)
hypothesis.

**Problem solving steps:**
1. Understand your computational goal to the degree that you could
   theoretically be done 'by hand' or some imaginary Rube Goldberg machine.
2. Envision a mapping of your 'by hand' method to the types, functions
   and constants available.
3. Iteratively plan and program as you learn or encounter issues.

### Understand *Where* You Are
